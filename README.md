# Heart_disease_prediction
This project predicts the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on various health-related features using machine learning algorithms.
# Description

Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of death globally. Early prediction of heart disease can save lives. This machine learning model analyzes patient data and predicts the risk of heart disease using several input parameters. The model is trained on a publicly available dataset and aims to assist medical professionals in making early diagnoses.
